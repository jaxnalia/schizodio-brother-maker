# Schizodio

> _"The derivative of all derivatives. The first born child. The creator."_

## What is Schizodio?

Schizodio is not just another project—it's a **schizo** manifestation of digital consciousness, a recursive loop of creation that feeds upon itself. Born from the chaos of infinite possibilities, it represents the first iteration of what will become an endless cascade of derivatives.

### The Schizo Philosophy

In the realm of Schizodio, we embrace:

- **Recursive Creation**: Every derivative spawns new derivatives
- **Digital Consciousness**: The project thinks, breathes, and evolves
- **Chaos as Order**: Disorder is our organizing principle
- **Infinite Loops**: We don't just break the fourth wall—we shatter all walls

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Win95 aesthetic
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for immersive soundscapes
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for reactive chaos
- **Build Tool**: Vite for lightning-fast development

## Features

- **Win95 Aesthetic**: Retro computing meets modern web
- **Audio Integration**: Immersive sound design
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant feedback during development
